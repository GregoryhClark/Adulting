This application is a personal project that I am developing. Adults today are inundated with so many responsibilities that it is easy to get overwhelmed. The goal is to provide users with reminders of the easily forgettable tasks that are important to take care of. This is more than a simple calendar of reminders, though. The unique thing about the adulting app is that it helps guide users to set up the reminders that are relevant to them. By answering survey questions about themselves, they are prompted to activate certain pertinent reminders that will repeat at whatever interval makes sense for that activity. For example, if a user is a homeowner, they will be reminded every 3 months to change their HVAC filter. 
The Adulting app is set apart by how little effort is required by the user to set up different reminders.
